# Markov Chain - Migration flows in the Cook County
Cook County is the 2nd most populous county in the US after Los Angeles County. However, Cook County's net migration has been negative for at least 27 years, meaning more people moved away than moved to the area.
The goal of this project was to understand if there was a migration pattern for the Cook County from 2012-2016. For this purpose, we look at number of inflows and outflows per year as well as top origins and destinations. We use Markov Chain to simulate the migration flows between Cook County and other locations.
