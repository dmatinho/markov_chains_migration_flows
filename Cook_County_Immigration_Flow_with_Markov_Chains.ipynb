    "<br>\n",
    "Given that Cook County is one of the most populous counties in the U.S. (the third most populous, to be exact), there are large inflows and outflows into the county and consequently, a large number of origins and destinations for migration into and out of the county. By analyzing the data and determining the top origins and destinations for migration inflows and outflows, we will determine probabilities of migrating from Cook County to a certain destination and vice versa. Using this information we will create a transition matrix to model the Markov process. We will then create models that predict what the distribution of populations will look like over different periods and what it will look like over the long-term as it converges to the steady state.\n",

    "All the data we are using comes from the US Census Bureau wbsite, specifically the American Community Survey. This data estimates migration patterns between counties, metropolitan areas, and other statistical regions. We selected the data sets for count-to--county migrations available [here](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/migration/guidance/county-to-county-migration-flows.html \"County-to-County Migration Flows\") for time periods satarting from 2007 through 2016 (the last year available)."
